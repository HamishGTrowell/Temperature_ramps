Controller Script
Interval = .6	Set the time interval between commands to 0.6 seconds (0.01 min).

------------------
Initial Setup
------------------
[F1 LO +]	Lock the front panel controls (stop other users manually changing settings).

[F1 TC +]	Turn Temperature Control on.

[F1 PP +]	Turn on pump (should stay on even if temperature control is off)

[F1 SS S 1200]	Set Stirrer Speed to 1200 rpm (turns stirrer on).
[F1 TT S 20]	Set the Target Temperature to 20 degC.

[F1 CT +3]	Report Cuvette holder Temperature periodically (every 3 seconds).
[F1 PT +3]	Report Probe Temperature perodically (every 3 seconds).
[F1 HT +3]	Report Heat exchanger Temperature periodically (every 3 seconds).

[*CTD]		Clear time/temperature displays and set time to zero.

[*MSG + Click OK then click on "End Wait" at exact same time as UV-Vis measurement starts.]
[*D=1500]	Wait 15 minutes or until user clicks the "End Wait button".

[*CTD]		Clear time/temperature displays and set time to zero.

------------------
Solvent baseline UV-Vis
------------------
[F1 RR S 0.1]	Set Ramping Rate to 0.1 degC/min
[F1 TT S 100]	Set the Target Temperature to 100 degC to start the ramping process.
[*WCT>=100]	Wait until the Cuvette holder Temperature reaches 100 degC.
[*D 1500]	Wait 15 min to allow temperature to stabilise.

[F1 RR S 0.5]	Set Ramping Rate to 10 degC/min.
[F1 TT S 20]	Set Target Temperature to 20 degC to start the ramping process.
[F1 TC +]	Turn on Temperature Control to ensure pump runs (turns off automatically at high temperature).
[*WCT<=20]	Wait until the Cuvette holder Temperature reaches 20 degC.
[*D 500]	Wait 5 min to allow temperature to stabilise.

------------------
Clean up
------------------
[F1 PT -]	Stop periodic Probe Temperature reporting.
[F1 CT -]	Stop periodic Cuvette holder Temperature reporting.
[F1 HT -]	Stop periodic Heat exchanger Temperature reporting.

[F1 TC -]	Turn Temperature Control off.
[F1 PP -]	Turn off pump
[F1 SS -]	Stirring off.

[F1 LO -]	Unlock the front panel controls.

[*MSG + The linear temperature calibration script is complete. Remember to save your temperature data before closing software!]	Notify user with beeping.
